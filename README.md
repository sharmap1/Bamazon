tracks product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.

## Installation

You will need to have the following Node.js packages installed prior to running this application:
inquirer and MYSQL.

## Screenshots

Screenshots for each of the following versions of Bamazon have been included in this repository under the
folder "Screenshots."

make purchases.The screenshot demonstrates the following: invalid user input when ordering an item (item id and quantity),

with low inventory, add items to the inventory, and add new products. The screenshot demonstrates the following: how to view
all products, how to view products with low inventory, invalid user input when adding inventory (item id and quantity),
how to add items to the inventory, invalid user input when adding a new product (price and quantity), and how to add
a new product.The screenshot then shows that these changes are immediately reflected in the customer view.
